The following files will need to be in the directory:

$ ls

erfres.cpp
fnchyppr.cpp
mersenne.cpp
randomc.h
stoc1.cpp
stoc3.cpp
stocc.h
userintf.cpp
wnchyppr.cpp
wnhg8.cpp

All except the last are taken from Agner Fog, http://www.agner.org

To make the oct file, run 

$ mkoctfile wnhg8.cpp

This creates wnhg8.oct which can then be used with the rest of the
code
