Quick Start
===========

In Octave

> params;
> [mu,fval] = [y,fval]=solveEss(.5,p)

Should give the result

y =  0.58899


The Wallenius solver
====================

In the subdirectory wnhgsolver is C++ code for the Wallenius
distribution (from Agner Fog http://www.anger.org) and the file
wnhg8.cpp to generate wnhg8.oct. You can create your own by running

$ mkoctfile wnhg8.cpp
